EDUCATION
======
**Guangzhou University (GZHU)**
*Bachelor of Engineering (candidate)*
*09/2023 - Present*
* **Major:** Intelligent Manufacturing Engineering
* **GPA:** 3.51/4.0 (Rank: 8/57)
* **Weighted Avg:** 87.15/100
* **Relevant Courses:** Linear Algebra (94), Python Programming (93), Calculus (92), University Physics (90), C Programming Design (89).
* **Core Honors:** University First-Class Scholarship (Top 2%), Ranked 1st in Major in Comprehensive Evaluation (Sophomore), University Second-Class Scholarship (Top 9%), CET-4.

PROJECT EXPERIENCE
======
**HoLoRA-HSI: Hyperspectral Image Classification via Holographic Low-Rank Adapter**
*Project Leader (Supervisor: Xiaofei Yang)*
*06/2025-Present*
* Developed a parameter-efficient dynamic architecture to address the challenges of high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and lack of physical modeling in HSI classification. Specifically, the model introduces a Holographic Patch Embedding (HPE) mechanism to project patches into tokens group, overcoming the information bottleneck of standard ViTs by capturing non-local redundancies. To achieve instance-level adaptation, a Low-Rank Holographic Adapter (LRHA) was innovated, where low-rank matrices are generated via input-driven functions A(c) and B(c). Furthermore, a physics-guided Spectral Polynomial Prior (SPP) loss function was integrated to model spectral distortions, enforcing feature invariance against illumination changes and enhancing robustness.
* **Performance:** Achieved 94.96% Overall Accuracy (OA) on the Indian Pines dataset, outperforming SOTA models like SSFTT (94.02%) and MambaHSI.

**A Robot for Underwater Energy Pipeline Crack Detection**
*Core Member (Supervisor: Zhifu Li & Daqi Chen)*
*09/2024 - Present*
* Developed a high-performance underwater robot for pipeline inspection, focusing on stability and precision. The system features a Neural Network-enhanced Fuzzy PID controller that reduces navigation offset by 34% in complex currents, and an Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning module for thruster fault tolerance with a 0.7s response time. Additionally, an improved YOLOv11-based visual detection system was implemented, boosting crack detection accuracy by 14%, effectively solving traditional inspection difficulties.
* **Achievements:** National 2nd Prize (China Robotics & AI Competition), National 3rd Prize (Energy Saving Competition).

**Intelligent Trash Can System Based on Three-stage Differential Separation Device**
*Core Member (Supervisor: Wenting Deng)*
*01/2025-04/2025*
* Built an automated waste sorting system utilizing a three-stage differential separation mechanism and dual-servo precision control. The system employs an Arduino Mega 2560 for motion control and a CanMV K230 module for edge AI computing. Specifically, I was responsible for deploying the YOLOv5 model and optimizing the recognition algorithm, achieving a high classification accuracy of 99.74% across four waste categories. Additionally, I coordinated the mechanical-electrical integration and successfully filed an invention patent as the second student inventor.
* **Outcome:** Filed an invention patent (2nd Student Inventor).
